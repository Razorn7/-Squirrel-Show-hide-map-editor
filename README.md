<h1 align="center">In-game building show/hide editor by Razor.</h1>
# Introduction
I know that a lot of people who went through the scripting area at VC:MP find it boring or boring to go to the mED or any other map editor to get the ID and the coordinates of the object and then hide it or show it. Now with this editor, it is much easier to do this job.

# Guide:
Just enter the editor, use the command: /editmode on (BOOL), after that the server will give you an M60, shoot it against any object and press DELETE (To hide) or INSERT (To show) (WARNING: If you press DELETE to hide the object and then exit editing, it will not be possible to revert the object through automatic means).

# Commands and Keys:
/editmode <on/off> --> Enable/Disabled edit mode.
INSERT --> Show the object.
DELETE --> Hide the object.
BACKSPACE --> End the edition.

# Notes:
WARNING: If you press DELETE to hide the object and then exit editing, it will not be possible to revert the object through automatic means.
You can't delete LOD's using this editor.
